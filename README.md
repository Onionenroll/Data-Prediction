# Data-Prediction
ALY 6020
KNN 
is the model to sort out the numerical statistics, also categorical variables classify in the groups by distance (Euclidean distance)
Frame the prediction in certain range 92% is teh most common; otherwise is 65%-70% is still acceptable in training and testing set 
How to improve the accuracy inside of the model:
  a. larger sample size?
  b. outliers fillfulment 
  c. the point of building model is to classify the new variables with undefined labels
What are types of missing values (mean, median , mode and imputation); error types include anomalies and wrong type

Regression Model 
  a. Logistic Regression Model:
  b. Linear Regression Model: 
  c. Random Forest 
  d. Gradient boosting
  e. Binary Classification: GLM, logistic regression, support vector machine regression, or SVM 
  
Binary Classification Model: (confusion matrix)
  True positive       False Positive
  False Negative      True Negative 
How to manipulate the threshold output of the mdoel in risk tolerance 
  accruacy of the model represent in:
    a. precision rate: TP / (TP + FP)
    b. recall rate: TP / (TP + FN)
    c. overall Accuracy: (TP + TN) / All 
    
Entropy and Gini index:\
  a. Entropy describe the disorder and uncertainty sample
    a-1 our goal is to minimize uncertainty in lower entropy the better result is
    a-2 the more dataset is varied, the higher entropy is 
  b. Gini index: purity or impurity of sample looking for similiar data elements but less likely 
  measure in the misidentified
  
  c. Gradient boosting add layers for more accurate prediction in decision making 
  d. Benchmarking: comparabel remarkable model with the certain character 
    d - 1). accuracy (R^2, P^2, MSE), fit, speed 
    d - 2). AIC = 2k - 2ln(lamda) 
    d - 3). random forest 
    d - 4). benchmark model
  
  e. Neural Networks
    neural networks and linking functions to weighted the distribution of features and make
    decision, let weighted the significance of the elements first then decide in
    and multiple layer s
